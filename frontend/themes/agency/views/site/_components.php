                            <p class="text-muted">This service is combined with NEOSPACEâ€™s component kitting facility which means we can accept scheduled orders over a period of up to 3 months, which can help our customers with cash flow, logistics and potential obsolescence issues. This saves time as NEOSPACE carries out the logistical organisation, plus it will help improve your bottom line, allowing bulk buying and even recommendations for alternative, more economical components. Components supplied for your own inhouse assembly will be packaged and clearly marked,according to your instructions and NEOSPACE will organise the drop quantities.
                                        Note: All parts we offer are new and unused. In some cases due to severe obsolescence, we may have to offer second hand products. If this is the case we will not hide the fact about their condition. The recycling of components has become a major player in the obsolete market and is occasionally the only option, bar a redesign.
